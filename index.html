Vimeo began operations in 2004. It was started by Jakob Lodwick and Zach Klein, who previously co-founded CollegeHumor, a prominent joke website. Jack coined the name Vimeo as a play on the terms "Video" and "Me."
</p>

<p>
Initially, Vimeo was a side project for Jakob, who was concentrating his efforts on his primary website CollegeHumor. Vimeo's user base grew slowly over the next few years, primarily through word of mouth.

Vimeo did not remain in its infancy for long. IAC acquired CollegeHumor and Vimeo in August 2006, the same month Google acquired YouTube. Jake and his colleagues then worked full-time on Vimeo, attempting to distinguish it from YouTube and other similar services.
</p>

<p>
Soon after, Vimeo became the first video sharing site to give customers HD videos. Vimeo began supporting 4K streaming in 2014, 360-degree videos in March 2017, and 8K videos the following year.
